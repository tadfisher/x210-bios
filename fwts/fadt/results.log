fadt: FADT Fixed ACPI Description Table tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FADT X_FIRMWARE_CTRL 64 bit pointer was zero, falling back to using
FIRMWARE_CTRL 32 bit pointer.
Test 1 of 6: ACPI FADT Description Table flag info.

Test 2 of 6: FADT checksum test.
PASSED: Test 2, FADT checksum is correct

Test 3 of 6: FADT revision test.
FADT revision: 6.0
FADT table length: 276
WARNING: Test 3, FADT revision is outdated: 6.0

ADVICE: The most recent revision of the FADT defined in the ACPI specification
is 6.2. While older revisions of the FADT can be used, newer ones may enable
additional functionality that cannot be used until the FADT is updated.


Test 4 of 6: ACPI FADT Description Table tests.
PASSED: Test 4, Only one of FIRMWARE_CTRL and X_FIRMWARE_CTRL is non-zero.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32 bit DSDT and 64 bit X_DSDT both point to the same
physical address (0x8a7bf220).

ADVICE: While it is not correct to use both of the 32- and 64-bit DSDT address
fields in recent versions of ACPI, they are at least the same address, which
keeps the kernel from getting confused. At some point, the 32-bit DSDT address
may get ignored so it is recommended that the FADT be upgraded to only use the
64-bit X_DSDT field. In the meantime, however, ACPI will still behave correctly.

PASSED: Test 4, FADT first reserved field is zero.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT second reserved field is zero.
FADT Preferred PM Profile: 2 (Mobile) 
PASSED: Test 4, FADT has a valid preferred PM profile.
FADT indicates ACPI IS NOT in reduced hardware mode.
FADT SCI_INT is 9
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SMI_CMD indicates System Management Mode is supported, and
the SCI Interrupt is non-zero.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SMI ACPI enable command is non-zero, and SMM is supported.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SMI ACPI disable command is non-zero, and SMM is supported.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT indicates we are not in reduced hardware mode, and required
FACS is present.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT S4BIOS_REQ command is not set and FACS indicates it is not
supported.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT required PM1A_EVT_BLK field is non-zero
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_EVT_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_EVT_BLK fields are being used, but only
one should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at
least have a usable value.

SKIPPED: Test 4, FADT PM1B_EVT_BLK not being used.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT required PM1A_CNT_BLK field is non-zero
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_CNT_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM1A_CNT_BLK fields are being used, but only
one should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at
least have a usable value.

SKIPPED: Test 4, FADT PM1B_CNT_BLK not being used.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM2_CNT_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM2_CNT_BLK fields are being used, but only one
should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at least
have a usable value.

PASSED: Test 4, FADT 32- and 64-bit PM_TMR_BLK fields are at least equal.

ADVICE: Both FADT 32- and 64-bit PM_TMR_BLK fields are being used, but only one
should be non-zero. However, they are at least equal so the kernel will at least
have a usable value.

PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM1_EVT_LEN >= 4.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM1_CNT_LEN >= 2.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM2_CNT_LEN >= 1.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT PM_TMR_LEN is 4.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT GPE0_BLK_LEN non-zero and a non-negative multiple of 2: 32.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT GPE1_BLK_LEN is zero and GPE1_BLK is not supported.
FADT GPE1_BASE is 16
ACPICA Exception AE_NOT_FOUND during execution of method PXSX
ACPICA Exception AE_NOT_FOUND during execution of method PXSX
Using P_BLK address of 0x1810
WARNING: Test 4, FADT P_LVL2_LAT is > 100 (101) but a P_BLK is defined. This
implies a C2 state is not supported, but there is a P_BLK register block defined
which implies there might be a C2 state that works. There is not enough
information to determine if this is expected or not.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT P_LVL3_LAT is within proper range at 57
FADT FLUSH_SIZE is 1024
FADT FLUSH_STRIDE is 16
FADT DUTY_OFFSET is 0
FADT DUTY_WIDTH is 0
FADT DAY_ALRM is 13
FADT MON_ALRM is 0
FADT CENTURY is 50
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SLEEP_CONTROL_REG is null and not available when not in
reduced hardware mode.
PASSED: Test 4, FADT SLEEP_STATUS_REG is null and not available when not in
reduced hardware mode.
FADT Hypervisor Vendor Identity is 0

Test 5 of 6: Test FADT SCI_EN bit is enabled.
FADT is greater than ACPI version 1.0
PASSED: Test 5, SCI_EN bit in PM1a Control Register Block is enabled.

Test 6 of 6: Test FADT reset register.
PASSED: Test 6, FADT reset register width is 8 bits wide as expected.
PASSED: Test 6, FADT register bit offset is 0 as expected.
